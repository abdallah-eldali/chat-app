Developing a Trivia Game web application by using ReactJS as the front-end and ExpressJS with NodeJS as the back-end.
The web app will also have chat integration by using Socket.io for bidirectional communication between the server and client.

Currently only the skeleton for the front-end and back-end were created, and trying to figure out how ReactJS works and how to implement socket.io-client in the front-end.
