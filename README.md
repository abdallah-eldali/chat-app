# chat-app
Developing a Chat application by using ReactJS as the front-end and ExpressJS with NodeJS as the back-end, and Sccket.io for the bidirectional communcation between the two.

Currently only the skeleton for the front-end and back-end were created, and trying to figure out how ReactJS works and how to implement socket.io-client in the front-end.

Will soon use MongoDB as a database to store the room's, messages', and user's information, but for now I'm using a user.js file to simulate a database for testing.
